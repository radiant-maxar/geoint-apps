# Provenance

The licensing provenance of source files in the repository are explained
in this document.  In particular, this repository is an aggregate work of
existing packaging files that were released under distinct open source licenses.
As this aggregate work was originally based on NGA's
[Hootenanny RPMs](https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny-rpms), it is
licensed under the [GPLv3](../LICENSE); there is no intent
to supersede the original licensing of `.spec` files or patches -- and the
provenance of all external code will be explained here.  Unlike Hootenanny's
RPMs, source code archives are not kept in this repository and
downloaded upon RPM creation; licenses for these archives are noted for
convenience.

A majority of `.spec` files and patches in this repository were originally
sourced from Fedora, who uses the [MIT license](./licenses/Fedora-LICENSE)
([source](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Licenses/LicenseAgreement)).
In addition, the PostgreSQL Development Group (PGDG) was used as a source for
portions of the GEOS, GDAL, and PostGIS `.spec` files and patches.  PGDG uses
the  [PostgreSQL license](./licenses/PostgreSQL-LICENSE)
([source](https://download.postgresql.org/pub/README)).
